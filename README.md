# ðŸš— Hybrid Driver Fatigue Detection System on Edge Devices

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **real-time, hybrid driver fatigue detection system** optimized for **resource-limited edge devices** like Raspberry Pi.  
It combines **lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **geometric landmark-based analysis** to detect early signs of fatigue such as **eye closure** and **yawning**.

The hybrid fusion approach enhances accuracy, reduces false positives, and ensures efficient computation, making it ideal for **intelligent driver assistance systems**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Develop **lightweight CNN models** for detecting eye state and yawning.
- Integrate **geometric feature analysis** (EAR, MAR, head pose) to improve robustness.
- Optimize for **real-time inference** on **embedded devices**.
- Evaluate performance in terms of **accuracy**, **latency**, and **robustness**.

## ðŸ›  System Architecture
The fatigue detection pipeline follows these stages:

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**
2. **Facial Landmark Localization**
3. **Multi-Modal Feature Extraction** (Geometric + CNN)
4. **Hybrid Decision Logic**
5. **Alert Generation**
